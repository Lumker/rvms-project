5. How to Use the Project Effectively
Once set up, here's how to proceed:
Session 1: Infrastructure Module

Start with: "Let's develop the Infrastructure module for RVMS. Begin with the water systems management component."
Claude will have full context of your existing patterns and can build consistently

Session 2: Service Delivery

Continue with: "Now let's build the Service Delivery module, focusing on community issue tracking."

Session 3: Economic Development

And so on...


6. Sample First Message for the Project

When you start your first conversation in the project:

Hi! I'm ready to continue developing the Rural Village Management System (RVMS). 

Based on our established codebase and patterns, I'd like to start with the Infrastructure module. Let's begin with:

1. Create the infrastructure app structure
2. Design models for water systems, electricity, roads, and facilities
3. Build views and templates following our rural-focused design patterns
4. Include the filtering, bulk operations, and export features like in municipality_list.html

Please start with the infrastructure models.py file, keeping in mind this needs to integrate with our existing household/resident data for rural communities.

7. Benefits of This Approach
✅ Persistent Context: Claude remembers your entire system architecture
✅ Consistent Development: Follows established patterns automatically
✅ Faster Development: No need to re-explain your system each time
✅ Better Integration: Claude understands how modules connect
✅ Quality Assurance: Maintains your coding standards and design patterns

This project-based approach will allow us to systematically complete your RVMS while maintaining the high quality and rural focus you've established. The knowledge base will ensure every new component integrates seamlessly with your existing work.
