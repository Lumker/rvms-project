Excellent idea! Creating a Claude Project for your Rural Village Management System (RVMS) will allow us to maintain context across conversations and systematically complete the development. Here's how to set it up effectively:
Setting Up Your RVMS Claude Project

1. Create the Project

Go to your Claude interface
Click on "Projects" in the sidebar
Click "Create Project"
Name it: "Rural Village Management System (RVMS)"
Add a description: "Comprehensive Django-based governance and administration platform for South African rural communities. Household/resident-centric system for managing villages, municipalities, demographics, and document processing."

2. Project Knowledge Base Setup

Add these key documents to your project knowledge base:

Document 3: Template Patterns (template_patterns.html)

<!-- Include your updated municipality_list.html as a reference pattern -->
<!-- Include your sidebar.html -->
<!-- Include your header.html -->
<!-- This shows Claude your design patterns and coding style -->

Document 4: Development Standards (development_standards.md)



Document 5: URL Structure (url_structure.py)

# Document your current URL patterns
# This helps Claude understand your routing conventions
